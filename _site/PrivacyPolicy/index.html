      <p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>Denis Dmitriev built the FlashSpeak app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Denis Dmitriev at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

<p>For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to –. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.</p>

<p>I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.</p>

If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.</p>

<p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>

<p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
  <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
  <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
  <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it.

If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services, please contact us.
