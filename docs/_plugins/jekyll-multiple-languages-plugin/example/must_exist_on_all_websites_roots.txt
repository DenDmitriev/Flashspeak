This file exists for testing purposes only to verify possible bugs on the Jekyll
Multiple Languages Plugin.



With  the  default configuration of the demo website, this file should be copied
and exist on the translated sites and main site root folders.

If this file is not on one of the directories this means that there is an error,
probably  on  the static  file  exclusion  code  that  currently  resides on the
":site, :post_render hook".
