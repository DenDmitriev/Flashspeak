Minimal website using multiple languages plugin
===============================================

![Jekyll Multiple Languages Plugin](../brand/jekyll_multiple_languages_plugin_logo.png)

Features:
- Internationalization of the website
- Per-post translation link
- Permalinks demo
- Pagination demo

Notes:
- The website is based on Flex theme.
- It does not work with GitHub pages because the I18N plugin is not in the main
  Jekyll repository and is not considered "safe".
