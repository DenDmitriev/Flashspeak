## SVG Source Files

The Jekyll Multiple Languages Plugin logo is a fork of the original Jekyll logo created by Coby Chapple ([@cobyism](https://github.com/cobyism)).


## Font

The free font, [Arizonia](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Arizonia), used on the logo, is in the `fonts` directory.
This is the same free font used on the original Jekyll logo.

Since the SVG logo has editable text, you should install the font to see the text properly.


## PNG Image
There's a small resolution PNG image that is included on the project's documentations.
